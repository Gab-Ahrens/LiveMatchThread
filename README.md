## Hosting Options

The bot can run in two modes:

### 1. Continuous Mode (Legacy)
- Runs as a continuous process
- Internally schedules all thread creation
- Requires a persistent hosting environment

### 2. Job Mode (Recommended for free hosting)
- Runs as a scheduled job that starts, checks for needed actions, and exits
- Perfect for free hosting platforms with execution time limits
- Can be scheduled with:
  - Cron jobs (Linux/Unix)
  - Task Scheduler (Windows)
  - GitHub Actions
  - Free scheduler services (cron-job.org, etc.)

## Setting Up Scheduled Execution

For best results with free hosting, schedule the job to run every 15-30 minutes:

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Run Match Thread Bot

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/15 * * * *'  # Every 15 minutes

jobs:
  run-bot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run job
        env:
          # Set all your environment variables here
          FOOTBALL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FOOTBALL_API_KEY }}
          REDDIT_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.REDDIT_CLIENT_ID }}
          # ...other env vars
```

### External Scheduler Service
1. Deploy your app to a service like Render, Netlify, or Vercel
2. Create an endpoint that triggers the bot job
3. Use a service like cron-job.org to hit that endpoint every 15-30 minutes

## Smart Refreshing

The bot implements smart data refreshing:
- Fetches match data once every 24 hours
- Persists refresh state between bot restarts
- Fetches lineups separately, 1 hour before kickoff and again right before posting
- State data is stored in the `data/` directory (not committed to repository)

## Development Mode

The bot supports two development flags:

- `USE_MOCK_DATA=true`: Uses local mock data instead of making API calls
- `DRY_RUN=true`: Previews thread content without posting to Reddit

## Working with Mock Data

The bot includes tools for working with mock data to facilitate development:

- `npm run capture-mock-data`: Captures live API responses to use as mock data
- `npm run clean-mock-data`: Cleans up old mock data files
- Mock data is stored in the `mock-data/` directory

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development - Continuous Mode
npm run dev:mock    # Mock data + no posting
npm run dev:dry     # Real API + no posting
npm run dev         # Real API + real posting

# Production - Continuous Mode
npm run build
npm start

# Job Mode (for scheduled execution)
npm run build
npm run job         # Real API + real posting
npm run job:dry     # Real API + no posting
npm run job:mock    # Mock data + no posting
```
