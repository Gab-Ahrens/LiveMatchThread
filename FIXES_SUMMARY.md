# Bot Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Multiple Post-Match Thread Creation** ✅
**Problem**: The bot was creating multiple post-match threads for the same match.

**Root Causes**:
- Multiple execution paths in `PostMatchScheduler` could trigger thread creation
- Race conditions between polling completion, timeout fallback, and irregular match endings
- Missing state checks before posting threads
- No protection against concurrent execution

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added `isAlreadyPosted()` checks at multiple critical points:
  - Before starting polling
  - Before each posting attempt
  - In timeout fallback function
  - In delayed posting callbacks
- Added race condition protection with multiple safety checks
- Improved state management to prevent duplicate execution

### 2. **API Rate Limiting** ✅
**Problem**: The bot could exceed the 100 calls/day limit, especially during match polling.

**Improvements**:
- Reduced polling frequency from 60 seconds to 120 seconds (saves ~30 API calls per match)
- Added comprehensive API call tracking system (`apiCallTracker.ts`)
- Added API limit checks before every API call
- Created API usage monitoring utility (`checkApiUsage.ts`)
- All API functions now respect the 100 calls/day limit

### 3. **Bot Restart Issues** ✅
**Problem**: When the bot restarted during an ongoing match, it would restart polling from the beginning.

**Solutions**:
- Added check for already completed matches on startup
- Improved estimated end time calculation
- Added final status check for matches that likely already ended
- Better handling of post-match thread setup after restarts

### 4. **Preview Display Issues** ✅
**Problem**: Post-match thread preview showed "null" scores because it tried to fetch final data before match completion.

**Solutions**:
- Separated preview logic for mock data vs live data
- Created placeholder preview for live matches
- Improved preview formatting with proper team names and nicknames

## Technical Improvements

### API Call Tracking System
- **File**: `src/utils/apiCallTracker.ts`
- Tracks all API calls with timestamps and purposes
- Provides warnings when approaching limits
- Stores data persistently in `data/api-calls.json`

### Enhanced State Management
- Multiple safety checks prevent race conditions
- Better integration with existing thread state system
- Improved error handling and logging

### Polling Optimizations
- Reduced polling frequency (60s → 120s)
- Better error handling with exponential backoff
- Maximum polling duration limits
- Smarter polling restart logic

## Files Modified

1. **`src/schedulers/PostMatchScheduler.ts`**
   - Added multiple `isAlreadyPosted()` checks
   - Improved polling logic with race condition protection
   - Enhanced preview functionality
   - Better restart handling

2. **`src/api/apiClient.ts`**
   - Added API call tracking to all functions
   - Added API limit checks before each call
   - Integrated with new tracking system

3. **`src/utils/apiCallTracker.ts`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive API call tracking
   - Daily limits monitoring
   - Detailed usage analytics

4. **`src/utils/checkApiUsage.ts`** (NEW)
   - Utility to check current API usage
   - Breakdown by endpoint
   - Warning system for approaching limits

## Usage Recommendations

### Daily API Usage Monitoring
```bash
# Check current API usage
npm run check-api-usage

# Or programmatically
import { checkApiUsage } from './src/utils/checkApiUsage';
checkApiUsage();
```

### Expected API Usage Per Match
- **Pre-match**: ~1-2 calls (match data, lineups attempt)
- **Match thread**: ~3-5 calls (match data, lineups, last 5 matches for both teams)
- **During match**: ~60 calls (120s polling for 2 hours)
- **Post-match**: ~3 calls (final match data, events, statistics)

**Total per match**: ~67-70 API calls

### Safety Margins
- Bot now stops making API calls when limit is reached
- Warnings at 80 calls, critical alerts at 95 calls
- Graceful degradation when limits are hit

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Monitor API usage** during the first few matches
2. **Check thread state file** (`data/thread-state.json`) for proper state tracking
3. **Verify no duplicate threads** are created
4. **Test bot restart scenarios** during different match phases

## Configuration Notes

- Polling interval: 120 seconds (configurable in `PostMatchScheduler.ts`)
- API limit: 100 calls/day (tracked automatically)
- Maximum polling duration: 4 hours
- Post-match delay: 2 minutes after match end

The bot should now be much more reliable and respect API limits while preventing duplicate post-match threads.
